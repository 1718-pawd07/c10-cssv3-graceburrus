		<!--here we go-->
		<p>I have been a music lover since I was a small child. I loved classic rock and rock n' roll since it was the first kind of music I was introduced to. Since then my music taste has expanded to all genres. I have learned to appreciate and love all kinds of music for their similarities and differences.</p><img src="foofighters.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="jimi">
		<p>Music is something for everyone to enjoy and experience. I believe that music is a way for people to express themselves when words can't do it for them. Music is a way for people to connect and to learn more about each other.</p>
		<p>Sometimes people can get into a rut with music. I think that if people were more open-minded to trying different kinds of music they would fall in love with music just as I have.</p>
